# qMinderTest
This is the test task provided by qMinder.

I tried to use old API. However, it was not giving more than one page of images.
I used the method mentioned at Stackoverflow.

Notes : 

	* There is no testing in code,
	* There is no minifying for source or any automated tasks,
	* NodeJS is used only to host AngularJS application,
